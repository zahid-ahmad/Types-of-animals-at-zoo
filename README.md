# Zoo animals Classification usind nave bayes
The model is a Naive Bayes classifier that is designed to classify zoo animals into different types based on their features. The dataset used to train the model contains a variety of attributes, such as the animal_name	hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail	domestic, catsizeand class_type. The Naive Bayes algorithm is used to learn the relationships between these features and the animal types, allowing the model to predict the type of animal based on its features. The model works by first computing the probabilities of each feature given each animal type. These probabilities are based on the frequency of each feature in the training data for each animal type. The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that each feature is independent of all the other features, hence the term "naive". This assumption simplifies the calculation of the probabilities, making the model computationally efficient.

Once the probabilities of each feature are computed, the model uses them to calculate the posterior probability of each animal type given the observed features. The animal type with the highest posterior probability is then selected as the predicted type for the given set of features.

The model can be evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It can also be used to classify new, unseen data by computing the probabilities of each feature given the new data and then using these probabilities to predict the animal type. Overall, the Naive Bayes classifier is a useful tool for classifying zoo animals based on their features and can be easily adapted to different datasets and applications.
